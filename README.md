impress-zh
==========

This is a fork of a great presentation framework impress.js that was created as a quick fix of issues that arose when I was trying to use it together with Backbone.js Router. Might delete it when I find more elegant workaround.
To see original impress.js created by Bartek Szopka (@bartaz) visit [his project's website](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/).
